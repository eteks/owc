                    <p class="text_1">IOCD was founded at UNESCO in 1981 as the first international non-governmental organization specifically devoted to enhancing the role of the chemical sciences in the development process and involving chemists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In its first 35 years, it has undergone a number of evolutionary changes, shifting from an early emphasis on building individual and institutional capacities for chemistry research in LMICs to strengthening capacities for management, policy and innovation and towards advocacy for the field.</p>
                    <p class="text_1">IOCD promotes the pursuit and application of the chemical sciences for sustainable, equitable human development and economic growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The organization’s current focus is on two priority areas:</p>
