Actions involving chemistry don’t just ‘happen’: they occur because of decisions that people take, individually or collectively. These decisions may result from diverse human motivations, including curiosity and aspirations for success, wealth, power or pleasure; and they are influenced by legal constraints, by societal pressures and by movements for the advance of collective local and global goals. </li></ul>
				            <ul class="style_pad"><li class="list_style_add system"> The ‘chemistry system’ therefore interlinks with a host of other overlapping systems including the biosphere, the environment, human and animal health, economics, politics, psychology and the law. </li></ul>

This must encourage policies, programmes and practices that are aware of complexity and prepared for unintended consequences.</p>
