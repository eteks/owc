				                    <p class="text_2 no-pad bold_italic_black">Traditionally, chemists have been trained largely, if not entirely in their own discipline and have then been drawn into engagement with scientists from other disciplines. However, there are disadvantages to this compartmentalization of sciences:</p>
				                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
				                    <span class="fl">-</span> <p class="text_1 fl"> Within a complex and mature discipline like chemistry, both the inspiration for research (whether ‘blue skies’ or ‘applied’) and the capacity to tackle problems often originates from knowledge or challenges coming from outside; and is increasingly dependent on the use of sophisticated techniques – such as advanced computing; analytical instrumentation, bioanalytical and biotechnology processes, methods of observation, measurement and manipulation – that often originate in another field. The history of advances in chemistry and the stories of many of the Nobel prizes in the field abound with examples of chemists who became aware of a problem or puzzling observation and of novel techniques that could be adapted for its investigation.</p>

					            <span class="fl">-</span> <p class="text_1 fl">Each stand-alone discipline has acquired a set of distinctive processes and methodologies. There are advantages in learning from an early stage how other branches of science think, what kinds of processes, techniques and measures they employ, how they think about constructing and testing hypotheses, what standards they apply to concepts such as purity and proof and what are considered to be the important fundamental and applied challenges in the field.</p>
					            <div class="clearfix"></div>
				            
				            
					            <span class="fl">-</span><p class="text_1 fl">Working effectively across disciplines does not come automatically – it requires the development not only of knowledge of other fields but also of skills (including communication, thinking outside the box, being able to synthesise information of diverse kinds, working in teams) that should be inculcated from an early stage of science education. </p>
					            <div class="clearfix"></div>
				            
				            <p class="text_1 no-pad">In addition to challenging the capacities of individual chemists to adapt to working with scientists in other disciplines, there are also major systemic barriers to working across disciplinary boundaries. These include factors intrinsic to the nature of chemistry itself; structural factors in academic institutions and the persistence of traditional attitudes towards discipline-based subjects that become silos; difficulties in securing research funds and in publishing work; and the relative lack of value that some institutions place on cross-disciplinary and multi-authored research, which can hamper career progression.</p>
				            <p class="text_1 no-pad">Nevertheless, chemistry has increasingly been drawn into cross-disciplinary engagements, the nature of which can take a number of different forms as illustrated below<sup>1</sup> (Note: while they can be categorised separately in principle as below, there are often overlaps in practice with elements of the different forms being used in combination or tandem.)</p>

The term ‘convergence’ has also been used to describe the approach to problem solving that cuts across disciplinary boundaries and integrates knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from diverse disciplines.<sup>5</sup></p>

Approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature need to be fostered for chemistry to most effectively contribute.</p>
		                    <p class="text_1">In an analysis of the field, four criteria were suggested6 for transdisciplinary research: (1) Problem orientation: research questions derived from "real-world" problems. (2) A suitable definition of sub-problems which is a prerequisite for the integration of the results. (3) Free choice of scientific methods adequate for each of the sub-problems. (4) Close relations between the sub-problems are crucial for the development of an overall solution. Once there is recognition of the real-world problem and the scientific problem is defined independently of disciplines, they propose a four-stage process of problem solving: (1) Understanding of the problem: Identification and analysis of main questions. (2) Separation of the problem into fields of application of different methods (sub-problems). (3) Solution of the sub-problems with mutual connections. (4) Integration of the results into a solution of the entire problem – with the cross-disciplinary results leading to application of the proposed solutions. Examples include</p>
