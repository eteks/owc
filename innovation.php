		                			<p class="innov">In a linear model of innovation, sequential steps of fundamental discoveries and applied research, followed by development and commercialisation, lead to valuable new products and processes. However, in the real world innovation is frequently much more complex than this, with innovation starting at different points, often being driven by a problem requiring a solution rather than a discovery looking for an application, and involving many feedback loops and reiterations across stages in a multiple set of interlocking innovation cycles. Unfortunately, in many places science and technology (S&T) are organized as if to fit the simple linear model of innovation; and this is often true of the field of chemistry, with obsolete divisions persisting between ‘pure’ and ‘applied’ research, between ‘research’ and ‘development’ and between ‘academic’ work and ‘commercialisation’.</p>

		            		<p class="innov">These divisions are reflected, for example, in the ways that academic chemistry departments are structured, in the ‘value’ that is attached to ‘cutting edge’, ‘pure’ research in academic career progression, in the separation of development and commercialisation into ‘off-campus’ sites and in the way that funding from public sources is allocated for research, development and innovation. The barriers to innovation are compounded by the lack of incentives for <a href="cross.php">cross-disciplinary research</a>, as well as by the evolution of orientations in some branches of the chemical industries (e.g. pharmaceuticals<sup>9</sup>) that have led to a weakening of in-house innovation capacities; and by insufficient attention by policy makers to fostering national environments for innovation and ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’.<sup>10</sup></p>

		             		<p class="innov">The innovation gap problem can be remedied for chemistry by approaching it at two levels. Clearly, in countries where the entire system of science, technology and innovation is not sufficiently strong (most countries?), efforts need to be made to engineer systemic improvements in policies, infrastructures and institutional architectures and practices. This is not, however, a problem that should be left to policy-makers and administrators: chemists must collaborate with others in science and technology, across academia and industry, to promote change and to define the kinds of changes that will improve the system. And in parallel, at the level of the discipline itself, chemists need to work to engineer the bottom-up changes that will enable the field to deliver – including the changes we highlight here concerning re-integration of the fragmented field, promotion of cross-disciplinary learning and research, systems thinking and an orientation towards problem solving alongside ‘blue skies’ fundamental research.</p>
