                <h4 class="heading_color"> Systems thinking: </h4>
                <p class="purchase-strip-text"> Taking account of the inter-relationships between human and animal health and the biological and physical environments of the planet requires thinking beyond solving immediate, separate problems. It necessitates being aware of whole systems (e.g. chemical, biological, environmental systems) and appreciating both how the internal dynamics of each system work and how the systems interact with and affect one another. In other words, One-World Chemistry requires us to engage in <a href="system.php"> Systems thinking. </a></p>

                <h4 class="heading_color"> Cross-disciplinarity: </h4>
                <p>A key requirement of the necessary redesign in chemistry &ndash; including the nature of the connections and engagements that chemistry makes to a host of other disciplines &ndash; is that both the teaching and practice of chemistry are informed by <b class="bold_italic_black"> systems thinking</b> and consequently embrace <b class="bold_italic_black">approaches that cut across disciplines.</b> These <a href="cross.php"> cross-disciplinary approaches </a>may be, as appropriate, multi-, inter- or transdisciplinary.</p>
                <div class="panel panel4 tab-content"> 
                  <p>Chemistry’s evolution as a well-defined and separate academic discipline has served the field well in the past. This has provided a secure base for research that has added to fundamental knowledge and contributed to technological applications in chemical and materials industries. From this base, chemistry has interfaced with a host of other scientific disciplines, contributing to theoretical and practical advances in diverse biological and physical fields.</p>
                  <p>But the nature of science &ndash; where, how and by whom it is performed and funded; how disciplines interact and how complex problems are tackled; how knowledge is created, stored, shared and valued &ndash; is changing fundamentally in the globalized world of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The traditional separateness of the chemistry discipline does not appear to be aligned with these changes and fundamental revision is now required in how chemistry is situated and how it engages beyond its own boundaries.</p>
                  <p>One example is the way that chemistry has been moving beyond the traditional territory of focusing on the properties and behaviour of atoms and molecules, towards increasing interest in non-bonded interactions. ‘Supramolecular chemistry’ explores a range of intermolecular relationships between chemical species created through synthesis; and the parallel field of ‘systems chemistry’ explores intermolecular relationships in natural systems and their role in the evolution and functioning of biological systems.</p>
                  <p>A common feature in both these strands of chemistry applied to non-bonded interactions is an effort to understand and utilize the phenomenon of self-assembly. The new chemistry perspectives have been reflected in the US National Academies report<sup>1</sup> entitled <b class="bold_italic_black">‘Beyond the molecular frontier’</b> and the essay<sup>2</sup> by Whitesides on <b class="bold_italic_black">‘Reinventing chemistry’</b> in which he spoke of the need for chemistry to expand its mission from “molecules,” to “everything that involves molecules.”</p>
