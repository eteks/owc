The physicians’ principle of ‘do no harm’ is a good starting point for all practitioners of the sciences (as well as everyone else in society). In 2015, a group of chemists (including Henning Hopf, one of the authors of One-World Chemistry) convened by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons developed a consensus in the form of The Hague Ethical Guidelines<sup>30</sup> based on ‘norms of the practice of chemistry’. The main elements of the guidelines align closely with the principles of One-World Chemistry.</p></div><div class="intro-content-wrap col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 pull-left no-pad content_with_hypen" style="visibility: visible;"><p class="black_italic"><b class="heading_color">Main elements of the Hague Ethical Guidelines:</b></p><div id="class_intro" class="text-indent"><ul><li class="text_1 black_italic list_style_add"><b>Core element.</b> Achievements in the field of chemistry should be used to benefit humankind and protect the environment.</li></ul><ul><li class="text_1 black_italic list_style_add"><b>Sustainability.</b> Chemistry practitioners have a special responsibility for promoting and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</li></ul><ul><li class="text_1 black_italic list_style_add"><b>Education.</b> Formal and informal educational providers, enterprise, industry and civil society should cooperate to equip anybody working in chemistry and others with the necessary knowledge and tools to take responsibility for the benefit of humankind, the protection of the environment and to ensure relevant and meaningful engagement with the general public.</li></ul><ul><li class="text_1 black_italic list_style_add"><b>Awareness and engagement.</b> Teachers, chemistry practitioners, and policymakers should be aware of the multiple uses of chemicals, specifically their use as chemical weapons or their precursors.
