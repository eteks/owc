			               	   			<p>As the authors of ‘One-World Chemistry’ have argued, chemistry’s capacity for innovation and ability to serve as the basis of a wide range of technologiesmean that it can make a pivotal contribution to meeting the SDGs8,9. The chemical sciences can be drivers for poverty reduction and inclusive, sustainable economic growth and industrialization (Goals 1,8,9). They can help reduce inequalities and make urban environments resilient and sustainable (Goals 10,11) and help avert and mitigate climate change and its impacts. They canassist in addressing environmental damage to air, sea and land (Goals 13,14,15), furnishing new agricultural and pharmaceutical processes and products (Goals 2,3) and developing more efficient and more sustainable processes for providing clean water, sanitation, energy  and sustainable production (Goals 6,7,12).</p>
			                			<p>The chemical sciences can play a role in the delivery of quality education and lifelong learning that is based in gender equality and empowerment (Goal 4); assist in countering military uses of chemical warfare and promoting disarmament and the peaceful uses of technology (Goal 16); and across all these areas operate through global partnerships and alliances that work for collective benefit to the health, well-being and sustainable development of all people (Goal 17).</p>
