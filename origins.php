	                <p class="text_1"> During a conference on <b class="black_italic">Chemistry Education as an Agent in Global Progress</b>.in June 2015, IOCD scientist Stephen Matlin gave a paper on <a href="http://www.iocd.org/v2_PDF/ChemContribGlobalProgress2015Matlin.pdf" target="_blank">‘The Contribution of the Chemical Sciences to Global Progress: Achievements, Prospects and Challenges’.</a> In the course of his presentation, he drew on the example of the global health threat posed by anti-microbial resistance and noted that the solution being encourages was a ‘One Health’ approach which recognized that animal and human health and the environment are inter-connected. He commented that <b><b class="bold_italic_black">“we need to have a similar orientation in our thinking about the chemical sciences, which projects them as taking a harmonized and comprehensive systems approach to understanding and solving global challenges”.</b></b></p>

The IOCD group published a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v8/n5/full/nchem.2498.html" target="_blank"> paper </a> in <i>Nature Chemistry</i> in 2016, introducing the concept which embodies the group’s view that chemistry must go beyond <b class="black_italic">‘being a science’</b> and embrace <b class="black_italic">‘being a science for the benefit of society’.</b> </p>
