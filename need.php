Examples of growing problems that have been recognised include:</p>

                            <li class="text_1 list_style_add text-indent">By-products and waste products from manufacturing processes – and the actual products themselves when they are scrapped – sometimes find their way into the environment, damaging the biosphere and the environment. Examples include waste plastic microparticles, ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons and greenhouse gases.</li>

                            <li class="text_1 list_style_add text-indent"> Agricultural production has been increased dramatically in the last hundred years due to the development of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and plant growth regulators as well as to the development of new, higher-yielding plant varieties. These advances ensured that there was sufficient food on the planet to feed the world’s rapidly population during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but as the population continues to grow, further increases in the volume and efficiency of production will be essential. However, the use of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and plant growth regulators can have impacts on plants, insects, birds, animals and people and they must be properly tested, regulated and monitored for all their effects if they are to be used safely and in a sustainable way.</li>

                        <li class="text_1 list_style_add text-indent"> The development of antibiotic resistance by micro-organisms presents one of the greatest challenges to global health in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in bacteria, fungi and parasites results from natural evolutionary changes caused by their exposure to antibiotic dugs – and this is related to a complex set of factors that include the use of drugs in human health and animal husbandry and their leakage into the environment:</li>

                    <div class="text_2">

                            <li class="black_italic list_style_circle">Antibiotics have saved countless millions of lives since their introduction in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. But their over-use and misuse (including for viral infections, where they are ineffective; and failure by patients to complete courses of treatment, which favours the selection of resistant organisms) and leakage into the environment (including through waste water and refuse dumping) have contributed to the evolution of resistance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="black_italic list_style_circle"> Extensive use of antibiotics in agricultural production, both to protect farm animals from infection and to promote their growth, has encouraged the evolution of AMR.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="black_italic list_style_circle"> Run-off from agricultural production, as well as the transfer of human water and solid wastes contaminated with antibiotics, into the environment has contributed to the evolutionary selection pressures that promote AMR.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text_1 padding_20 text-indent"> For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the efficient discovery and commercialization of new natural and synthetic antibiotics by the pharmaceutical industry meant that there was a steady pipeline of new drugs able to combat emerging AMR problems. However, since 1988 not a single new class of antibiotics has been developed for human use and the armoury of available antibiotics is decreasing rapidly. This ‘antibiotic void’ has resulted from declining commercial incentives for the production of new antibiotics, as well as structural changes in the pharmaceutical industry itself that have impacted on the innovation system. The world is now almost at the point of running out of antibiotics that are effective against life-threatening infections caused by resistant organisms. This would have a major impact on human health and on the practice of medicine, with many hospital procedures – including all surgery – becoming much riskier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text_1 padding_20 text-indent"> AMR presents a clear example where systems effects – including the systems concerned with the innovation of new antibiotic drugs, with the rational use of antibiotics in human and animal health and with the transfer of antibiotics into the wider environment – are central to an understanding of the emergence of a major, global challenge and where attention must be given to all of the overlapping systems in developing solutions to what will otherwise be a global crisis for human health.</li>

                        <li class="text_1 list_style_add text-indent" style="margin-bottom:10px;"> Reserves of the Earth’s natural resources, including fresh water, minerals and fossil fuels, are finite. With the increasing growth of pressures from population expansion, urbanization and economic development, many of these resources are now facing prospects of depletion and severe shortages in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Sustainable processes for the production of energy, clean water and materials need to become the core of science, innovation and commerce if the world is to move from a destructive track of over-consumption of its natural resources to a constructive track of balance, conservation and sustainable development. The chemical sciences have a central contribution to make to these sustainable approaches, requiring an enhanced awareness of how the multiple global systems of resources and physical and ecological environments interact.</li>
